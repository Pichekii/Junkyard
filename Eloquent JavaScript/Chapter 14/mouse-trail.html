    In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with
    lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring ways to
    use the language.

    One of these was the “mouse trail”—a series of images that would follow the
    mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.

    In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely
    positioned <div> elements with a fixed size and background color (refer to
    the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an example). Create a bunch of
    such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of the
    mouse pointer, somehow.

    There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as
    simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to keep
    a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one
    to the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.
