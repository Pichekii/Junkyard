/**
 * FizzBuzz
 * 
 * Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
 * with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
 * number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
 * 
 * When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for
 * numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
 * 
 * (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a
 * significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, youâ€™re
 * now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
