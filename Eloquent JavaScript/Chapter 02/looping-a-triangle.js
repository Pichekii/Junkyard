/**
 * Looping A Triangle
 * 
 * Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
 *      #
 *      ##
 *      ###
 *      ####
 *      #####
 *      ######
 *      #######
 * 
 * It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing
 * .length after it.
 * 
 * var abc = "abc";
 * console.log(abc.length);
 * // â†’ 3
 * 
 * Most exercises contain a piece of code that you can modify to solve the
 * exercise. Remember that you can click code blocks to edit them.
