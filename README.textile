h1. Overview

The @Junkyard@ repository is a collection of projects I have worked on at some
point or another, which may be in various states of completion.

The repository contains projects from school, examples from tutorials, interview
questions, projects I created for work, etc. Basically, if it ends up in here,
then I'm no longer working on it or I don't have any practical use for it.
