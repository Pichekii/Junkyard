h1. Overview

The @ECE@ directory contains programs I wrote for the @EE 312@ course
provided by the @ECE@ department at The University of Texas at Austin.

The programs do not include project files for an IDE; they are solely C/C++
files that can executed from an interpreter like "CINT":http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cint.
